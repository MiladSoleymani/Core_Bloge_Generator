Here is a patient-friendly summary based on the “High blood pressure and stroke” fact sheet by the Stroke Foundation.  ￼

⸻

What is high blood pressure and why it matters for stroke
	•	Stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked (by a clot or plaque) or when a blood vessel in the brain bleeds. Brain cells starve of oxygen and can die, causing lasting damage.  ￼
	•	High blood pressure (hypertension) means your blood exerts too much force on blood vessel walls over time. This damages vessels throughout the body—including in the brain—and is the most preventable cause of stroke worldwide.  ￼
	•	Because it usually has no symptoms, many people don’t realise they have high blood pressure (“silent killer”) unless they measure it.  ￼

⸻

How high blood pressure causes stroke

High blood pressure contributes to stroke in multiple ways:
	•	It weakens blood vessel walls, which can rupture and cause bleeding in the brain.  ￼
	•	It can damage or dislodge plaque in arteries, leading to clots that block blood flow to brain tissue.  ￼
	•	High blood pressure also accelerates related heart conditions like atrial fibrillation, which can generate clots that travel to the brain.  ￼

⸻

Causes & risk factors of high blood pressure

Several factors are linked to developing high blood pressure:
	•	Non-modifiable: family history, ageing, male sex (somewhat higher risk)  ￼
	•	Modifiable:
  • Excess weight or obesity  ￼
  • High salt (sodium) intake in diet  ￼
  • Excess alcohol consumption  ￼
  • Physical inactivity  ￼
  • Smoking, diabetes, poor diet  ￼

What blood pressure levels mean & action steps

The fact sheet includes a simple categorisation of readings and recommended action:  ￼

Blood Pressure Category	Reading (mmHg)	Recommended Action
Severe hypertension	≥ 180 / 100	Immediate action — see your doctor urgently  ￼
High blood pressure	≥ 140 / 90	See your doctor for full risk assessment  ￼
Normal	~ 120-140 / 80-90	Monitor risk factors; discuss with doctor if high side or you have other risks  ￼
Optimal	≤ 120 / 80	Good level — maintain healthy lifestyle  ￼

Bear in mind: this is only an assessment based on BP. Other risk factors (smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, family history) should also be considered.  ￼

What you can do: behaviour & lifestyle advice

To reduce your blood pressure and stroke risk, the fact sheet and related Stroke Foundation resources suggest:
	•	Maintain or reach healthy weight
	•	Eat a healthier diet, especially limiting salt (all sodium in food, not just table salt)  ￼
	•	Be active regularly
	•	Limit alcohol
	•	Don’t smoke, manage blood sugar and cholesterol
	•	Have your blood pressure checked regularly — especially if you have risk factors like family history or older age  ￼

Also, if you use a home blood pressure monitor:
	•	Use a validated, accurate device
	•	Measure under consistent conditions (same times, rested, no caffeine or smoking 30 min prior)
	•	Take multiple readings and bring results to your health professional  ￼

⸻

When to seek medical help
	•	If your blood pressure is in the severe range (≥ 180/100 mmHg) — this is urgent and you should see a doctor immediately.  ￼
	•	If your routine readings are in the high BP range (≥ 140/90 mmHg) — see your doctor for a full cardiovascular and stroke risk assessment.  ￼
	•	If you have multiple risk factors (diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking) — speak with your GP about combined risk.
	•	If lifestyle changes don’t bring your BP down adequately — medication and specialist care may be needed.
