Here’s a patient-friendly summary of the “Aboriginal heart health” page from St Vincent’s Heart Health:

⸻

Background & Context
	•	This page is part of a collaboration between St Vincent’s Heart Health and the Heart Foundation to create specially tailored heart health resources for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  ￼
	•	It acknowledges that heart disease is the number one cause of death in Australia, and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities experience disproportionately high burden.  ￼
	•	The site aims to deliver culturally appropriate content (stories, images, animations, videos) for these communities.  ￼

Key Information & Content Offered

Heart recovery & self-care

The site offers resources on recovering after a heart event, with culturally tailored guidance:  ￼
	•	Get moving — how to safely increase physical activity after a heart problem  ￼
	•	Eat good tucker — guidance on healthy eating suited to heart recovery  ￼
	•	Rehab / Cardiac rehabilitation — a program combining education and exercise classes to help recovery and prevent recurrence  ￼
	•	Medicines — information on “what, why, when and how” to take heart medicines  ￼
	•	Returning to activities — advice on when to resume hobbies, work, etc.  ￼
	•	Scar care — caring for surgical incisions after heart surgery  ￼

Additional supports & community resources
	•	The “More help” section directs to links such as Heart Attack Warning Signs, Support & Resources (Heart Foundation), brochures, rheumatic heart disease information, and a “find your nearest cardiac rehab” tool.  ￼
	•	“Stories” section shares personal stories by Aboriginal people in their own languages about their heart condition.  ￼
	•	The site also connects to content on Rheumatic Heart Disease through Aboriginal artwork and educational material.  ￼

Health disparities & risk context
	•	Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, compared to non-Indigenous Australians:  ￼
• They have higher levels of risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, overweight, diabetes, and high blood pressure  ￼
• They are almost twice as likely to have heart disease, and three times more likely to have a heart attack.  ￼
• They are less likely to use cardiac rehabilitation, despite their higher disease burden.  ￼
• Younger age groups (25–34) have notably elevated risk of cardiac events in some communities.  ￼

⸻

Behaviour / Lifestyle Advice & Practical Steps
	•	The resources emphasise healthy eating (“good tucker”) as a core part of heart health and recovery.  ￼
	•	Encourages physical activity, progressively and safely, after heart events.  ￼
	•	Participation in cardiac rehabilitation is highlighted as beneficial but underutilised in Aboriginal communities.  ￼
	•	Medication adherence and correct use of medicines is part of the recovery advice.  ￼
	•	Self-care post surgery or event includes knowing when to resume daily activities and caring for scars.  ￼
	•	The site supports community engagement by sharing local stories and culturally relevant materials to improve awareness and trust.  ￼

When to Seek Professional Help
	•	Whenever experiencing heart symptoms or warning signs (e.g. chest pain, shortness of breath) — immediate medical evaluation is necessary. (Implied via “Heart Attack Warning Signs” link)  ￼
	•	After a heart procedure or diagnosis, health professionals (cardiologists, cardiac rehab teams) should guide decisions on exercise, medicines, lifestyle changes.  ￼
	•	For those with risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity), getting regular checkups, risk assessments, and personalised care is important. (Implied via risk disparity context)  ￼
