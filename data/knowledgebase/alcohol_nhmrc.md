Here is a 400-word plain-language summary of the “Alcohol – NHMRC” guidance:

⸻

Background

Alcohol is the most widely used drug in Australia and, even though many people drink socially, it carries health risks for the person drinking and sometimes for others.  ￼
The NHMRC publishes evidence-based guidelines to help Australians understand and reduce those risks.  ￼

⸻

Main Recommendations

Guideline 1: For healthy adults (over 18 years)
	•	To reduce the risk of alcohol-related disease or injury, men and women should drink no more than 10 standard drinks per week.  ￼
	•	On any one day, one should not exceed 4 standard drinks.  ￼
	•	Importantly: “the less you drink, the lower your risk of harm” — so drinking less is always safer.  ￼

Guideline 2: Children and people under 18
	•	To reduce risk of injury and harm to health, children and adolescents (under 18) should not drink alcohol.  ￼

Guideline 3: Pregnancy and breastfeeding
	•	Women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should not drink alcohol to prevent harm to the unborn child.  ￼
	•	While breastfeeding, the safest option is no alcohol.  ￼

⸻

What Is a Standard Drink?
	•	A “standard drink” in Australia contains 10 grams (g) of pure alcohol.  ￼
	•	This measure applies regardless of whether the drink is beer, wine, spirits, or mixed drinks.  ￼
	•	Examples given include:
• Full strength beer, 285 mL  ￼
• Wine or sparkling wine, 100 mL  ￼
• Spirits, 30 mL  ￼

⸻

Behaviour & Lifestyle Advice
	•	The guidelines emphasise moderation — staying within limits rather than aiming for “safe drinking” levels.  ￼
	•	Because risk increases with more drinking, drinking less often and not binge drinking can reduce harms.  ￼
	•	There is no completely risk-free level of alcohol; the less you drink, the safer you are.  ￼

⸻

When to Seek Professional Help or Support
	•	If you find it difficult to stick within these limits, or worry about your drinking pattern, talk to your GP, an alcohol service or counsellor.
	•	If you already have health conditions (liver disease, heart disease, mental health issues) or take medications that interact with alcohol, seek medical advice before drinking.
	•	If you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, or caring for a child and considering alcohol use, consult health professionals for safe guidance.
