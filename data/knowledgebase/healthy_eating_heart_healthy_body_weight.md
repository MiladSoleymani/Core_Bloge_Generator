Here is a plain-language summary based on the “What is a healthy weight for height?” page on the Heart Foundation website:

⸻

Background

The Heart Foundation explains that Body Mass Index (BMI) is commonly used to assess whether your weight is healthy in relation to your height.  ￼
BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared (kg/m²).  ￼
However, BMI is only one tool. It doesn’t measure body fat distribution (where fat is stored) nor does it take into account muscle mass, age, gender, or ethnic differences.  ￼

The page also notes that waist circumference is important: excess fat around the waist (abdomen) is more strongly linked to heart disease risk.  ￼

Main Recommendations & Advice

Healthy weight targets & measurements
	•	The Heart Foundation suggests that losing 5–10% of your current weight can lead to meaningful health benefits (e.g. reduced heart disease risk).  ￼
	•	For waist circumference, they use these reference values:
• Men: about 94 cm
• Women: about 80 cm
Having measurements above these suggests elevated risk.  ￼
	•	The Foundation emphasises that a heart-healthy eating pattern, combined with physical activity, is a sustainable approach to help achieve and maintain healthy weight.  ￼

Heart-healthy eating pattern (linked advice)

The page refers to a companion resource, “Eating well for a healthy weight”, which recommends the following eating principles:  ￼
	1.	Plenty of vegetables, fruits and wholegrains
	2.	A variety of healthy protein sources — fish, legumes, nuts, seeds; smaller amounts of eggs and lean poultry; lean red meat limited to 1–3 times per week  ￼
	3.	Unflavoured milk, yoghurt, cheese — for those with high cholesterol, reduced-fat options preferred  ￼
	4.	Healthy fats — nuts, seeds, avocados, olive/other good oils  ￼
	5.	Use herbs/spices instead of salt to flavour foods  ￼

They highlight that many processed or fast foods (e.g. pizza, burgers, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks) are high in kilojoules, saturated fats, added sugar, and salt, but contribute little nutrition — these should be limited.  ￼

Cooking at home more often helps — because meals prepared outside often have higher levels of unhealthy fats, salt and sugar.  ￼

Behaviour & Lifestyle Advice
	•	Make small, sustainable changes rather than drastic “all or nothing” diets.  ￼
	•	Use tools like a BMI calculator (available on the Heart Foundation site) to monitor weight relative to height.  ￼
	•	Regularly measure waist circumference as part of tracking risk and change over time.  ￼
	•	Set realistic goals: for example, losing 5–10% of current weight.  ￼
	•	Be consistent with healthy eating and movement to help maintain weight loss and reduce regaining. (This is implied in the pattern recommendations and weight goals.)  ￼

When to Seek Professional Help
	•	If your BMI or waist measurement indicates high risk or you have other risk factors (e.g. heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension), talk with your doctor or an Accredited Practising Dietitian.
	•	If you struggle to lose weight despite following healthy patterns, you may need a personalised assessment or support.
	•	If you have medical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease) or are taking medications, professional guidance ensures safety.
