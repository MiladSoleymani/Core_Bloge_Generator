Here is a summary of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating based on the Eat For Health website.

What is the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating?

The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating is a visual food-selection guide. It shows how much of each of the five food groups you should aim to eat daily, using a plate-style diagram.  ￼

The guide is part of the broader Australian Dietary Guidelines, which provide science-based advice on how to eat to support health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.  ￼

Why it matters (background)

Eating well is essential for health, wellbeing, and disease prevention. Following a balanced dietary pattern helps ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs, maintain a healthy weight, and lowers your risk of long-term conditions like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.  ￼

The Guide is intended for generally healthy Australians. It is not meant to provide specialised nutrition advice for people with medical conditions or complex dietary needs.  ￼

What the Guide recommends

Five food groups

The guide divides food into five core groups. You should include nutritious choices from all of them each day:  ￼
	1.	Vegetables and legumes/beans
	2.	Fruit
	3.	Grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain and/or high in fibre
	4.	Lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts, seeds, legumes/beans
	5.	Milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives, ideally reduced fat in most circumstances

The proportion of each group is reflected visually: vegetables and grains take up a larger share, while protein and dairy are smaller segments.  ￼

Serving recommendations (for adults)

While exact amounts depend on age, gender and life stage, typical adult guidelines include:
	•	Grain foods: 4 to 6 serves per day  ￼
	•	Vegetables and legumes: at least 5 serves per day  ￼
	•	Fruit: about 2 serves per day  ￼
	•	Lean meats / alternatives: 2.5 to 3 serves per day  ￼
	•	Dairy / alternatives: 2.5 to 4 serves per day  ￼

These amounts are to be spread across the day (they don’t need to come in one meal).  ￼

Foods to limit (“discretionary choices”)

The Guide advises limiting foods and drinks that are not needed for health and tend to be high in saturated fats, added sugars, salt, alcohol, or too many kilojoules.  ￼

Examples include:
	•	Cakes, biscuits, ice-cream, desserts
	•	Processed meats, fried foods, takeaway fast foods
	•	Sugar-sweetened drinks
	•	Alcohol
These should only be eaten occasionally and in small amounts.  ￼

The Guide also supports drinking plenty of water as the main beverage choice.  ￼

Practical tips & lifestyle advice
	•	Aim to vary the types of foods you eat within each food group (for example, different vegetables or different protein sources) to get a wider mix of nutrients.  ￼
	•	Use the average serves calculator available on the Eat for Health site to find the right number of serves for your age, sex and activity level.  ￼
	•	Reserve discretionary foods for small amounts, and avoid making them regular habits.  ￼
	•	Focus on whole, minimally processed foods rather than packaged items with a lot of additives.  ￼
	•	Support and encourage breastfeeding (when applicable).  ￼
	•	Ensure you store and prepare foods safely to avoid foodborne illness.  ￼

⸻

When to seek professional help
	•	If you have a chronic medical condition (for example, diabetes, kidney disease, allergies) that requires special dietary care, these general guidelines may not be enough. Consult a dietitian or your doctor.  ￼
	•	If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, very young or elderly, your nutritional needs can differ—you may need tailored guidance.  ￼
	•	If you struggle to meet nutritional needs or maintain healthy weight, seek help from a qualified nutrition professional.  ￼
