Here is a plain-language summary of the “Quitline for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities” page from Quit (Australia).  ￼

What is the Aboriginal Quitline?

The Aboriginal Quitline is a specialised counselling service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who want to quit smoking or vaping.  ￼
It offers culturally sensitive support, embedding traditional ways of “yarning” (conversation), and ensures respect for Men’s and Women’s Business (i.e. gender preferences) in counselling.  ￼

How it works & how to access
	•	Call 13 7848 (13 QUIT) and ask to speak with a counsellor for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities.  ￼
	•	Alternatively, you can request a callback through an online form, and a counsellor will contact you, usually within two business days.  ￼
	•	You can also be referred by your GP, Aboriginal health service, or other health provider—just tell them you’d like to be connected to the Aboriginal Quitline.  ￼
	•	Tackling Indigenous Smoking (TIS) teams across Australia also link with the service and local smoking/vaping cessation efforts.  ￼

What makes this service tailored & supportive
	•	You are assigned one counsellor whom you continue talking with throughout your quitting journey, fostering trust and continuity.  ￼
	•	The counselling respects cultural preferences: you may request to speak with a woman or a man, depending on your comfort.  ￼
	•	The approach is non-judgemental — there is no pressure to do anything you are not ready for.  ￼
	•	The service can help with quitting smoking and vaping (including using vaping as a quitting tool if relevant).  ￼

⸻

Additional supports & community features
	•	There is an Aboriginal Quitline Facebook page where community members can share stories, tips, and updates.  ￼
	•	The page includes Quit Stories podcasts, where people tell their own quitting journeys in their own words.  ￼
	•	FAQs are available to answer common questions (e.g. about medications, withdrawal, and strategies).  ￼

When & why to use this service
	•	If you are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and contemplating quitting smoking or vaping, this service offers culturally relevant and continuous support.
	•	If you’ve tried before but relapsed or found general Quitline services less helpful, this service may feel more tailored and respectful of culture.
	•	If you’re using vaping to transition away from cigarettes or want help quitting vaping eventually, this service can support you through that process.
