Here’s a plain-language summary of the “Heart Healthy Eating Pattern” from the Heart Foundation:

⸻

Background

The Heart Foundation describes a heart-healthy eating pattern as a way of eating that, over time, supports cardiovascular health by focusing on nutrient-rich foods and limiting those that raise risk (like saturated fats, salt, and sugar).  ￼
It emphasises making small changes you can maintain long term, rather than rigid “good vs bad” dieting.  ￼

Main recommendations

The Heart Foundation suggests a 5-step approach to build a heart-healthy eating pattern:  ￼
	1.	Eat plenty of vegetables, fruit and wholegrains
	•	Choose a variety of colours and types of vegetables and fruit for vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.  ￼
	•	Prefer wholegrain breads, cereals, oats, brown rice, wholemeal pasta; high fibre wholegrains can help lower cholesterol.  ￼
	2.	Include a variety of healthy protein sources
	•	Plant-based proteins (legumes, nuts, seeds) are encouraged.  ￼
	•	Fish and seafood are recommended.  ￼
	•	Eggs and lean poultry are okay in moderation.  ￼
	•	Limit lean red meat to 1–3 times per week.  ￼
	3.	Choose unflavoured milk, yoghurt and cheese
	•	Pick varieties without added sugars.  ￼
	•	For people who have heart disease or high cholesterol, reduced-fat dairy is preferable.  ￼
	•	For those without those risks, you can use full fat or reduced fat.  ￼
	4.	Include healthy fats and oils
	•	Use sources such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive, canola, sunflower, peanut or soybean oils.  ￼
	•	These fats can help improve cholesterol levels.  ￼
	•	Eating fish 2–3 times per week gives beneficial omega-3 fats.  ￼
	5.	Use herbs and spices instead of salt
	•	Excess salt raises blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease.  ￼
	•	Much of Australians’ salt intake comes from processed foods.  ￼
	•	Use fresh or less processed foods, flavour with herbs/spices, and read food labels.  ￼

In addition:
	•	Portion balance
They suggest a simple plate guideline: fill half your plate with vegetables or salad, a quarter with protein foods, and a quarter with carbohydrate foods (wholegrains, starchy vegetables), plus include healthy fats.  ￼
	•	What to eat less of
Reduce intake of ultra processed foods (e.g. cakes, biscuits, sugary drinks, fast food) because they often contain high levels of salt, added sugar, and unhealthy fats.  ￼
	•	Drinks
Water is the best option.  ￼
Other acceptable options include unflavoured milk, calcium-fortified plant milks, tea, coffee, or small amounts of 100% fruit/vegetable juices.  ￼
Alcohol is not recommended for heart health.  ￼
	•	Eggs
Eggs can be included in a heart-healthy diet.  ￼
For most people, there is no need to limit egg intake because the cholesterol in eggs has less effect on blood cholesterol than saturated and trans fats do.  ￼
However, if you have heart disease, high LDL cholesterol or type 2 diabetes, the Heart Foundation recommends no more than 7 eggs per week.  ￼

Behaviour / lifestyle advice
	•	Make gradual, sustainable changes rather than attempting strict diets.  ￼
	•	Use their recipes, dinner plans, shopping tips and cooking tools to help apply these ideas in daily life.  ￼
	•	Read food labels to check for salt, sugar, saturated fat.  ￼
	•	Aim for variety from all recommended foods over days and weeks (not necessarily all at once).  ￼
	•	Understand processing levels: unprocessed & minimally processed are good; ultra-processed should be limited.  ￼

⸻

When to seek professional help
	•	If you already have heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or other chronic conditions, you may need more tailored nutrition guidance than this general advice.  ￼
	•	If you struggle to put the recommendations into practice, or your diet seems imbalanced, a dietitian or doctor can help you adjust based on your individual health needs.
	•	If you experience symptoms like unexplained weight change, fatigue, or worsening health, see your healthcare provider.
