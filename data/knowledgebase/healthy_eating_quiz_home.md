What is the Healthy Eating Quiz?

The Healthy Eating Quiz (healthyeatingquiz.com.au) is a free online self-assessment tool developed by Professor Clare Collins and her team at the University of Newcastle, Australia.  ￼
It is designed to evaluate how healthy someone’s usual dietary habits are, especially in terms of variety and alignment with the Australian Dietary Guidelines.  ￼

The quiz takes under 10 minutes. At the end, you receive feedback about your diet and how it compares to others in your age group. You can save results in a personal dashboard and track changes over time.  ￼

Key Points & Purpose
	•	The quiz measures the variety of healthy foods you typically consume.  ￼
	•	It uses a validated diet quality tool called the Australian Recommended Food Score to compare your diet against national dietary recommendations.  ￼
	•	The feedback is general — it does not account for individual medical conditions, allergies, supplement use, or special dietary needs.  ￼
	•	The team notes that it is not a diagnostic tool, nor a medical treatment plan.  ￼

What the Quiz Offers (Behaviour / Lifestyle Tips)
	•	You’ll see where your diet is strong (for example, good variety or strong food group coverage) and which areas may need improvement.  ￼
	•	Because it tracks over time, it can help you monitor progress as you adjust your eating habits.  ￼
	•	The website also emphasizes the importance of variety — eating many different vegetables, fruits, protein sources, grains, and dairy or alternatives.  ￼
	•	It encourages users to aim for a dietary pattern consistent with the Australian Dietary Guidelines.  ￼
	•	If needed, it points users to Accredited Practising Dietitians (APDs) for more tailored nutrition support.  ￼

When to Seek Professional Help
	•	If you have chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, kidney disease, food allergies, digestive disease), the quiz alone may not suit your needs — a clinical dietitian or doctor should advise you.  ￼
	•	If your nutrition or health goals are complex (e.g. weight management, pregnancy, malnutrition), use the quiz results only as a guide and consult a qualified health professional.  ￼
	•	If the feedback suggests serious gaps in your diet, or you notice symptoms (e.g. fatigue, unexplained weight changes, gastrointestinal issues), see your GP or dietitian for further assessment.
