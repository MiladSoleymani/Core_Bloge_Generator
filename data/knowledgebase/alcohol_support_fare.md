What the Page Offers

FARE’s “Alcohol Support Services” page provides a listing of Australian services and resources to help individuals or families who want to reduce or stop alcohol use, or otherwise manage alcohol-related harm.  ￼
It also includes a caution: if someone drinks heavily, reducing or quitting alcohol without medical supervision can be dangerous. It encourages consulting a doctor first.  ￼

What to Do & When to Seek Help
	•	If your alcohol consumption is high, don’t stop abruptly without medical supervision — withdrawal can carry health risks.  ￼
	•	Use the hotlines and services listed above if you want confidential advice, treatment referral, or peer support.
	•	If your drinking is affecting health, relationships, work or mood, or if you have other medical conditions, you should see a doctor or addiction specialist for a full assessment and treatment plan.
	•	Family and friends can use the family support services to learn how to support someone with alcohol problems while looking after their own wellbeing.
