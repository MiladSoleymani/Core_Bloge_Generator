Here’s a patient-friendly summary of the Tackling Indigenous Smoking (TIS) website and its role, based on content directly from that site:

What is Tackling Indigenous Smoking?

Tackling Indigenous Smoking (TIS) is an Australian program focused on reducing smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.  ￼
The TIS Resource & Information Centre (TISRIC) compiles evidence, resources and best practices to support smoking reduction efforts in Indigenous settings.  ￼

⸻

Goals & Key Functions
	•	Support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health by providing culturally appropriate programs and resources aimed at smoking cessation and prevention.  ￼
	•	Serve as a central hub for research, publications, and “what works” evidence in Indigenous smoking control.  ￼
	•	Offer planning and implementation guidance for communities and organisations working on tobacco control.  ￼
	•	Provide monitoring and evaluation tools, performance indicators, and support for funding and workforce development.  ￼

⸻

Key Areas of Focus & Target Populations

TIS works with a few priority groups to tailor interventions appropriately. These include:
	•	Remote communities
	•	Pregnant women and families
	•	Young people, including youth programs  ￼

The site provides interactive maps showing TIS teams by region.  ￼

⸻

Resources & Supports Offered
	•	Evidence & research on smoking and vaping in Indigenous populations
	•	Resource development (education materials, campaign assets)
	•	Community engagement tools and guidance for local health services
	•	Training and workforce support for those working in Indigenous tobacco control  ￼
	•	Stories of success from TIS teams to share approaches that have worked locally  ￼

The site also includes a “Yarning Places” section (links to social media, community forums) to share experiences and support.  ￼

Contact details include a toll-free number (1800 662 447) and email address (info@tacklingindigenoussmoking.com.au).  ￼

Why It Matters & How It Helps Individuals
	•	Smoking (and vaping) rates remain disproportionately high among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, contributing to preventable disease and death. TIS aims to close that gap by supporting culturally relevant interventions.  ￼
	•	By providing locally adapted programs, training, and evaluation tools, TIS helps communities implement what’s likely to work in their context, rather than imposed “one-size-fits-all” solutions.
	•	The focus on priority populations (e.g. pregnant women, youth, remote communities) means that support can be targeted where it may have the greatest long-term impact.

⸻

When to Use This Resource or Seek Help
	•	If you or your community are planning or running a smoking cessation / tobacco control program, TIS is a key resource for guidance, materials and evidence.
	•	If you belong to an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and want culturally sensitive support to quit smoking or vaping, local TIS teams may be accessible via this network.
	•	Health services, community organisations, schools or clinics working with Indigenous people can use TIS resources to design more effective programs or training.
	•	If you want to track progress, TIS provides monitoring tools and performance indicators to help measure success.
