Here is a plain-language summary of the “Weight loss – a healthy approach” fact sheet from the Better Health Channel (Victoria):

⸻

Background
	•	Being overweight or having too much body fat increases the risk of health problems such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  ￼
	•	Many people try fad diets or “quick fixes,” but although they may work while you stick with them, weight is often regained once usual eating resumes.  ￼
	•	Repeated cycles of losing and regaining weight (yo-yo dieting) can impair metabolism (the body burns fewer calories) and may itself raise heart disease risk.  ￼

Main Recommendations & Healthy Approach

1. Go slowly and sustainably
	•	A healthy pace of weight loss is about ½ to 1 kg per week.  ￼
	•	Making small, realistic changes you can maintain long term is better than extreme diets.  ￼
	•	Avoid “crash” diets or extreme restrictions; your body may respond by lowering its metabolic rate (burning fewer calories) and losing muscle along with fat.  ￼

2. Understand your “energy in vs energy out”
	•	Weight change depends on the balance between energy you consume (food/drinks) and energy you use (movement, daily activity, exercise).  ￼
	•	It helps to track your current habits. Keeping a food diary (what you eat, when, hunger/emotions) may reveal patterns that lead to unhelpful eating.  ￼
	•	Also tracking physical activity (formal exercise and incidental movement like walking, gardening, standing) helps see where you can increase “energy out.”  ￼

3. Build a healthy weight-loss plan (SMART goals)
	•	Specific: define exactly what change you’ll try (e.g. “eat 2 pieces of fruit daily”).  ￼
	•	Measurable: use numbers or amounts.  ￼
	•	Achievable & Realistic: set goals you believe you can follow, given your life.  ￼
	•	Time-bound: give a time frame (e.g. by the end of month).  ￼
	•	Start with just one or two small changes. Once those are habits, add more.  ￼

4. Nutrition strategies (energy in)
	•	Base your eating pattern on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.  ￼
	•	Increase vegetables and fruit—especially vegetables, which tend to be lower in kilojoules and higher in fibre to help keep you full.  ￼
	•	Be mindful of portions. Larger servings mean more kilojoules.  ￼
	•	Reduce foods high in added fats (especially saturated fat), sugar, and salt.  ￼
	•	Treats, soft drinks, snack foods and alcoholic drinks should be occasional extras—not regular staples.  ￼
	•	Do not eliminate entire food groups; instead choose less-processed, more nutritious options.  ￼
	•	Drink water instead of sugary drinks.  ￼
	•	Avoid emotional or distracted eating (e.g. snacking while doing something else).  ￼

5. Movement strategies (energy out)
	•	You don’t need to do extreme workouts. Even 30 minutes of moderate activity daily can help.  ￼
	•	Increase incidental movement: walk more, stand, take stairs, do gardening, or any activity you enjoy.  ￼
	•	Begin slowly, especially if you have been inactive for awhile.  ￼

6. Staying motivated & measuring progress
	•	Don’t rely only on the scale. Also use waist circumference (targets: < 94 cm for men, < 80 cm for women) and how your clothes fit or your energy/fitness changes.  ￼
	•	Be kind to yourself. Slips or plateaus are expected—adjust goals or timelines as needed.  ￼

⸻

When to Seek Professional Help
	•	If you have tried many times without success, or if your weight history is complex, consider seeing an Accredited Practising Dietitian.  ￼
	•	If you have health conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or are older, talk with your GP before starting significant changes in diet or exercise.  ￼
