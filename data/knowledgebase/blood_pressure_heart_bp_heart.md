Here is a plain-language summary of “Blood pressure and your heart” from the Heart Foundation:

⸻

Background

Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps it around the body.  ￼
High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular conditions.  ￼
Because it often has no symptoms, many people don’t know they have elevated pressure.  ￼

⸻

How blood pressure is measured & what’s “normal”
	•	Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:
• Systolic (top number): pressure when your heart contracts
• Diastolic (bottom number): pressure when your heart relaxes between beats  ￼
	•	A typical “normal” reading is under 120 / 80 mmHg  ￼
	•	Readings higher than this may indicate elevated or high blood pressure — your doctor can tell you what’s ideal for your health.  ￼

⸻

What causes high blood pressure & why it matters

Risk factors / contributors

High blood pressure usually develops over time and is influenced by factors such as:
	•	Family history / genetics  ￼
	•	Eating habits (especially high salt intake)  ￼
	•	Excess body weight, particularly around the waist  ￼
	•	Low physical activity  ￼
	•	Alcohol intake, smoking  ￼
	•	Stress, caffeine or temporary influences (e.g. recent activity) can also cause short-term rises  ￼

Why it’s harmful

When blood pressure is too high over time:
	•	It puts strain on blood vessels and the heart
	•	It increases the chance of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and damage to arteries  ￼

⸻

How to measure blood pressure & track it
	•	Use a validated blood pressure monitor (at home or in a clinic)  ￼
	•	Best practice for home measurement:
• Take readings for 5–7 days (minimum 5) at consistent times (morning/evening)  ￼
• Sit quietly beforehand, support arm, don’t smoke or consume caffeine 30 min before  ￼
• Take two measurements one minute apart and record them  ￼
	•	Bring your records to your doctor so they can assess your average blood pressure over time  ￼

⸻

How to lower and manage high blood pressure

Lifestyle changes (first-line)
	•	Healthy diet: Follow a heart-healthy eating pattern, reduce salt intake, and replace saturated fats with healthier fats  ￼
	•	Physical activity: Aim for at least 30 minutes most days; reduce time spent sitting  ￼
	•	Maintain healthy weight: Even modest weight loss helps lower blood pressure  ￼
	•	Limit alcohol: Because alcohol can raise blood pressure, reducing intake can help  ￼
	•	Don’t smoke, manage stress, and look after your mental health  ￼

Medication (if needed)

If lifestyle changes are insufficient, or your blood pressure is high, your doctor may prescribe one or more types of antihypertensive medicines (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, diuretics) to reduce risk.  ￼

⸻

When to see a health professional
	•	If you have repeated high readings or blood pressure outside the normal range
	•	If lifestyle changes alone don’t adequately lower your blood pressure
	•	If you have other risk factors (e.g. diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease)
	•	If you experience symptoms like headache, vision changes, chest pain or breathlessness (though high blood pressure is often symptomless)
