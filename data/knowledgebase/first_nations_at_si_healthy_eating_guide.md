Here is a patient-friendly summary of the “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Guide to Healthy Eating” poster (2 pages) from Eat for Health:

⸻

What is this guide

This resource is a culturally adapted version of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, designed to be relevant and accessible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  ￼
It’s intended as a simple visual reminder (poster format) to help people choose healthy foods and lifestyle habits.  ￼

⸻

Key messages & recommendations

Drink water and limit sugar
	•	“Drink plenty of water” is placed at the top: water is the best drink choice.  ￼
	•	The poster advises to limit foods and drinks with added sugar, and to avoid adding extra sugar to tea or coffee.  ￼

Eat a variety from the five food groups

You should aim to include foods from all five food groups every day:
	1.	Vegetables and legumes / beans  ￼
	2.	Fruit  ￼
	3.	Grain (cereal) foods, especially wholegrain or high-cereal fibre varieties  ￼
	4.	Lean meat & alternatives (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts, seeds, legumes)  ￼
	5.	Milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives, preferably reduced fat for most people  ￼

The poster also includes the reminder: “Use small amounts only sometimes and in small amounts” for less healthy choices (i.e. discretionary items).  ￼

⸻

Foods / nutrients to limit & healthy choices

The poster offers specific tips:
	•	Saturated fat: limit fried foods, trim fat from meat, remove skin from chicken, choose reduced-fat milk.  ￼
	•	Salt: don’t add salt while cooking or at table, and choose lower-salt foods.  ￼

⸻

Additional healthy habits & encouragement
	•	Be active every day is part of the poster’s message.  ￼
	•	It offers healthy snack ideas (though these are not detailed in the excerpt) as part of its side recommendations.  ￼
	•	The poster uses empowering language: “Eat healthy, stay strong and live long.”  ￼

⸻

When to seek guidance or adapt
	•	Although this poster gives general guidance, people with special health needs (e.g. diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, pregnancy) should consult with a health professional or dietitian to adapt these recommendations safely.
	•	If you notice that following the guide isn’t helping with health goals (e.g. weight control, blood sugar), checking in with a clinician or Aboriginal health service is advised.
