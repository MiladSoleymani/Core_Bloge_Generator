Here is a 400-word plain-language summary of the “Ten Top Tips for Weight Control” from the RACGP’s HANDI program, based exactly on their content:

⸻

Background & Purpose

The RACGP describes Ten Top Tips as a habit-change intervention aimed at helping people with overweight (BMI 25–30) or obesity (BMI >30) to control weight by building healthy routines.  ￼
Traditional weight-loss approaches that rely only on motivation and education often lose effectiveness over time. The habit-based approach focuses on simple, repeatable behaviours that become automatic.  ￼
Clinical trials of Ten Top Tips show short-term weight loss is achievable and that some benefits persist for 12 months.  ￼

The tip package is delivered in a consumer leaflet format, and people can self-apply it at home.  ￼
There are precautions: people with complex medical needs (e.g. multiple comorbidities) or very severe obesity may require tailored dietitian or specialist support.  ￼

The Ten Tips (Main Recommendations)

The TEN tips are simple actions intended to become habitual:
	1.	Keep to a meal routine
Eat at roughly the same times each day (whether 2 or 5 meals).  ￼
	2.	Go reduced fat
Choose reduced-fat options (dairy, spreads, dressings) and use high-fat foods sparingly.  ￼
	3.	Walk off the weight
Aim for 10,000 steps per day (≈ 60–90 minutes of moderate activity). Use a pedometer, take stairs, walk more in daily life.  ￼
	4.	Pack a healthy snack
If snacking, pick nutrient-dense foods (fruit, plain yoghurt, nuts) instead of chips, chocolate, etc.  ￼
	5.	Learn food labels
Read labels for fat, sugar content when shopping or preparing foods.  ￼
	6.	Caution with your portions
Don’t heap your plate (except vegetables). Think twice before second helpings.  ￼
	7.	Up on your feet
Break up sitting time — stand for 10 minutes every hour. Use opportunities to stand more (on transport, breaks).  ￼
	8.	Think about your drinks
Choose water first. Limit unsweetened fruit juice to one 200 ml glass daily. Alcohol is high in calories — limit to 2 drinks/day.  ￼
	9.	Focus on your food
Slow down. Avoid eating while multitasking (e.g. TV, driving). Eat at a table if possible.  ￼
	10.	Do not forget your 5 a day
Aim for at least 5 portions (≈ 400 g) of mixed vegetables and fruit daily.  ￼

Implementation in studies often includes a brief induction (by nurse or dietitian) plus a self-monitoring form.  ￼

Behaviour / Lifestyle Advice & Supporting Principles
	•	The key is repetition and simplicity — repeated practice leads to automation (habit).  ￼
	•	The approach may be as effective or more effective than traditional behaviour-change strategies alone in sustaining weight control.  ￼
	•	The leaflet is designed for self-use in home settings, but combining it with professional guidance (especially in higher risk or complex cases) may improve outcomes.  ￼

⸻

When to Seek Professional Help
	•	If you have comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease) or complex nutritional needs, see an Accredited Practising Dietitian or your GP for tailored care.  ￼
	•	If you have severe obesity or difficulties achieving or maintaining weight loss with self-help, a specialist weight management service may be more appropriate.  ￼
	•	If the tips are not working, or you experience health changes (e.g. fatigue, new symptoms), consult a clinician to reassess your plan.
